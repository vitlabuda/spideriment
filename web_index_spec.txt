--- Spideriment web index file specification ---


The web index file is a CSV of JSON objects (each CSV entry is a JSON object).*
Its save location is specified by the Settings.WEB_INDEX_FILE property in the Settings.py file.


Each JSON object represents a single crawled webpage and consists of the following properties:
    "original_url" (string)                     = the original URL which was navigated to when crawling the webpage
    "final_url" (string)                        = the final URL of the webpage (differs from original_url, if the request was redirected)
    "original_canonical_url" (string)           = the original URL in its canonical form
    "final_canonical_url" (string)              = the final URL in its canonical form
    "crawl_timestamp" (int)                     = the Unix (epoch) timestamp when the webpage was crawled

    "language" (string)                         = a short string describing the language of the webpage (e.g. en, en-US, cs, cs-CZ, ...; <html lang> - might be invalid)
    "title" (string)                            = the webpage's title (the contents of the <title> HTML element)
    "headings" (object of arrays of strings)    = the webpage's headings (<h1>, <h2>, ...); saved as a object whose keys signify what the level was (e.g. h1); its values are arrays of the headings' texts
    "description" (string)                      = the webpage's description (<meta name="description">)
    "keywords" (string)                         = the webpage's keywords (<meta name="keywords">)
    "author" (string)                           = the webpage's author (<meta name="author">)
    "content_snippet" (string)                  = a snippet from the webpage's content
    "content_snippet_quality" (float)           = a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 determining how relevant the content_snippet is (may be used when ranking the results in a search engine)
    "image_alts" (string)                       = whitespace-concatenated alts of the webpage's <img> elements (may be used as an additional ranking factor)
    "link_texts" (string)                       = whitespace-concatenated texts of the webpage's links (<a href> elements; may be used as an additional ranking factor)

    "total_links_count" (int)                   = the total number of links found on the webpage (may be used as an additional ranking factor)


The strings (title, content snippet etc.) might be empty and are cut, if they are too long (the last word of the metadata might be "cut in half").
The length limits are specified in the Settings.py file.



* The web index is not saved as a single JSON array, because it can get very huge and JSON isn't easily parsable/appendable without having it loaded entirely in the memory.
  The JSON objects are wrapped in CSV due to the possibility of them containing newline characters (which makes simply saving one JSON object per line without the CSV wrapping impossible).
